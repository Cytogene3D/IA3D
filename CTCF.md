## Identifying the CTFC binding sites

### A site containing almost everything 
https://dozmorovlab.github.io/CTCF

See section **CTCF predicted and experimental data**:  _in silico_ predictions as well as Encode data are available

The R package can also be tested.

### Alternative: Detecting CTCF _by hand_ using Fimo
https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/fimo.html

#### Install Fimo using conda (suggestion)  
https://anaconda.org/bioconda/meme

#### Download the 3 PWM matrices of the CTCF binding sites (JASPAR format)
