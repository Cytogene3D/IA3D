## Functionnal Elements

Functionnal annotations can be obtained via several databases

### From Ucsc
see https://genome.ucsc.edu  
for example using the Table browser  
  https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables  

### From Ensembl
see https://www.ensembl.org  
for example using FTP download  
https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html

### From ENCODE
see https://www.encodeproject.org/data/annotations  

### Already downloaded
see https://web-genobioinfo.toulouse.inrae.fr/~faraut/IA3D/data/func

### Proposed functional elements

#### CTCF
see https://github.com/Cytogene3D/IA3D/blob/main/CTCF.md  
Experimental CTCF binding sites data can be found here

### ChiP-seq file format
Bed format for ChiP-seq is Bed6 (is it narrow peak)  
https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12

Peaks were detected by MACS
