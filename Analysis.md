# Studying the Orca matrices

## The sample matrices

Two sets of matrcices, 
 - observed : corresponding to real HiC data
 - wiltype : Orca predictions made on the same region

```bash
wget https://web-genobioinfo.toulouse.inrae.fr/~faraut/IA3D/observed.tar.gz
wget https://web-genobioinfo.toulouse.inrae.fr/~faraut/IA3D/wildtype.tar.gz
```
Consider recoding the R code in notebooks/OrcaMatrices.ipynb in python
